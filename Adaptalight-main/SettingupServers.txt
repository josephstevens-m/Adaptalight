These are the servers that have to be installed 


sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install node-red
sudo apt-get install mosquitto
sudo apt-get install mosquitto clients

# The next part of this will be to set up the MQTT Broker
# all of the configs are there 

# /etc/mosquitto

# create a file called pwfile in the mosquitto folder
# and put the user and password in it seperated by a colon
# password file should follow this format
# username:password
# steve:qwerty  (this is an example)

# you then use mosquitto_passwd -U pwfile to hash it

# Also you need to add the following 3 lines to the conf file

# allow_anonymous false
# password_file /etc/mosquitto/pwfile
# listener 1883

# example of how to start the server - u is the user -P is password
# To configure the user name and password when starting  server -u is username -P is password
# -u testnode -P admin -t is the topic
#
# mosquitto_sub -d -u testnode -P admin -t dev/test
#
# This is how you can see if the service is running 
# netstat -an | grep 1883

###########################traditional lamp stack. 

# next is to setup the SQLiteDB with an interface 
# This will be done by first installing apache2 
# Then php and the modules needed to connect to the DB

sudo apt-get install apache2
sudo apt-get install php libapache2-mod-php php-sqlite3 -y
sudo apt-get install sqlite3

#Setting up the php server you need to incldue the following
# sudo nano /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dir.conf
# then add index.php in front of the index.html
# in /var/www/html create a file index.php 
# write this <?php phpinfo(); ?> and then save it 
# Now try to enter the ip of the server in a browswer and the PHP info should show.

# Next install the phpLiteAdmin_v1-9-7-1 check phpliteadmin.org for latest
wget https://bitbucket.org/phpliteadmin/public/downloads/phpLiteAdmin_v1-9-8-2.zip



# mounting the USB for the DB
