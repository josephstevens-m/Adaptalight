fileTools-3.py


This is a tool that connects to the Apogee and reads the file 
ApogeeConnectLog.csv 

It then uses MQTT to send to a client that has 
username:testnode
password:admin

It sends to a topic dev/test on the raspberry pi




-u testnode -P admin
netstat -an | grep 1883

all of the configs are there
/etc/mosquitto

you have to make a pwfile for the password then use mosquitto_passwd -U pwfile to hash it
Also you need to add the following to the conf file

allow_anonymous false
password_file /etc/mosquitto/pwfile
listener 1883


password file should follow this format

username:password
steve:qwerty

example of how to start the server - u is the user -P is password -t is the topic

 mosquitto_sub -d -u testnode -P admin -t dev/test -v


mosquitto_sub -d -u testnode -P admin -t dev/test


This is the formula for calibration from Kuhlgert 2016
(PAR=white×0.65847+ red×−1.60537 + green×−2.30216 +blue×−0.50019).


PAR = (white * White 0.65847) + (Red*1.60537)+(Green*2.30216)+(Blue* 0.50019)
